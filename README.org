* Hangman With Haskell
Basics of IO programming using a variant of the game Hangman.

* How to play:
- One player secretly enter a word.
- Another player then tries to deduce the word via a series of guesses.
- For each guess, we indicate which letter in the secret word occur in the guess.
- The game end when the guess is correct.
